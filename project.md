# Hand Recognition Project Summary

## Current State

### Architecture
- **Backend (FastAPI)**
  - WebSocket-based real-time hand detection
  - Optimized frame processing with 30 FPS cap
  - Improved error handling and status reporting
  - MediaPipe for hand landmark detection
  - XGBoost model for finger counting

   - Real-time detection of up to two hands
   - Accurate landmark detection (21 points per hand)
   - Left/right hand differentiation

2. **Gesture Recognition**
   - Accurate finger counting (0-5 fingers)
   - Position and rotation invariant
   - Works with both hands simultaneously
   - Robust against partial occlusions

3. **Data Collection & Training**
   - Structured data collection pipeline
   - Data augmentation capabilities
   - Comprehensive evaluation tools
   - Easy model retraining process

## Areas for Improvement

### Immediate Fixes
